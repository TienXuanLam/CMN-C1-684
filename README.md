# CMN-C1-684 — Agent Health Resource Monitor Agent

> **Category**: Cat 1 (delivers a single technical capability, generic and use-case-agnostic)
> **Industry**: CMN (common / cross-industry)

## Overview

Collects system/container resource metrics (CPU, memory, disk, GPU) for a specified
target (bare metal / Docker / Kubernetes), evaluates them against caller-supplied
thresholds, and produces a structured health report with per-dimension
NORMAL/WARN/ALERT annotations. The agent is fully deterministic — no LLM call is
involved in metric collection or evaluation.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design spec and test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
